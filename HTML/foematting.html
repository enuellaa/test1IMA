   <h1><ins>What is Motivation?</ins></h1>
   <p>Scientists define motivation as your general <strong>willingness</strong> to do something. <br> 
    It is the set of psychological forces that compel you to take action. <br>
    That's nice and all, but I think we can come up with a more useful definition of motivation. <br>
</p>
<p>So what is <em>motivation</em>, exactly? The author <cite>Steven Pressfield</cite> has a great line in his book, <br>
<mark>The War of Art</mark>, which I think gets at the core of motivation. <br>
To paraphrase Pressfield, <q>At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.</q> <br>

<h2><ins>Creatives follow A Routine</ins></h2>
<p>The work of top creatives isnâ€™t dependent upon motivation or inspiration, but rather it <br>
follows a consistent pattern and routine. Here are some examples of how you can apply <br>
ritual and routine to get motivated: <br>
<pre>
<b>Exercise consistently</b>: Use the same warm up routine in the gym.

<b>Become more creative</b>: Follow a creative ritual before you start working.

<b>Start each day stress-free</b>: Craete a five minute morning meditation ritual.

<b>Sleep better</b>: Follow a "power down" routine before bed
